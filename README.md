## Introduction

The Multiple Disease Prediction project aims to create a **user-friendly web application** that allows users to input relevant medical information and receive predictions for different diseases. The machine learning models are trained on disease-specific datasets to enable accurate predictions.

---

## Features

- **User Input**: Age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health parameters.
- **Disease Prediction**: Uses ML models to predict the likelihood of:
  - Diabetes
  - Parkinson's Disease
  - Heart Disease
- **Prediction Results**: Displays the probability and status for each disease.
- **Visualization**: Highlights important factors contributing to predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use without technical knowledge.
